🚀 About Me

Hi there 👋
I’m a Aspiring DevOps & Cloud Engineer with a strong foundation in Linux systems, containerization, and modern web infrastructure.
Coming from a background in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, I combine analytical problem-solving with a systems-thinking approach to build reliable, secure, and scalable environments for software operations.

I’m passionate about the intersection of development and infrastructure — bridging gaps between code and production through automation, observability, and cloud-native practices.

⚙️ Focus Areas

Infrastructure as Code – automated provisioning & deployment pipelines

Containerization & Orchestration – Docker, Kubernetes, and microservices

Monitoring & Reliability – Sentry, Cloudflare Analytics, metrics-driven stability

CI/CD & Automation – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Vercel workflows

Cloud & Networking – AWS (EC2, S3), Cloudflare (DNS, Zero-Trust Tunnel)

Security – Zero-Trust API exposure, IAM least privilege, CORS/SSL configuration

🧱 Selected Projects

🔹 Full-Stack PWA with Production-Grade Cloud Infrastructure
Serverless Next.js app deployed on Vercel, integrated with MongoDB, Resend, Sentry, and AWS S3.
Includes CI/CD pipelines, Cloudflare security, and cron-based automation.

🔹 CultMap – Cultural Exploration Platform (Microservice Architecture)
Cloud-native platform with Dockerized microservices, deployed via AWS EC2 + Cloudflare Tunnel.
Implements automated deployment scripts, secure API exposure, and Kubernetes-ready modular services.

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: TypeScript, Python, Shell
DevOps & Cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EC2, S3), Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, Terraform
Backend: Node.js, Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
Monitoring Sentry, Cloudflare Analytics, Vercel Logs & Analytics, ELK-Stack, Grafana , Prometheus
Security: SSL/TLS, IAM, CORS
Tools: Linux, Git, VS Code, Cursor

💡 Fun Fact

I enjoy building production-like infrastructure for side projects, treating every deployment as an opportunity to refine automation, reliability, and cloud-architecture design.
